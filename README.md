This project involves predicting whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit based on various client and call details. Term deposits are a major source of income for retail banking institutions, and targeted marketing campaigns, particularly telephonic marketing, can significantly enhance the conversion rates. By identifying the clients most likely to subscribe, banks can optimize their resources and reduce costs associated with large call center operations.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify clients who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. This allows the bank to focus its telephonic marketing efforts more effectively and efficiently.
